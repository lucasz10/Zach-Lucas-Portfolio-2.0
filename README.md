This is a Professional portfolio that I have developed to keep up with projects as I go through my web development bootcamp. As projects are completed, they shall be added with an image, as well as a link to the deployed projects that functions when a user clicks on the image.

Page features functional navigational tools to various sections on the webpage. Contact information is found in the footer.

A link to the deployed app can be found [here](https://lucasz10.github.io/Zach-Lucas-Portfolio-2.0/)
