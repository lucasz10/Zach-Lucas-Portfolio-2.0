            I absolutely love volleyball, and have been actively playing since
            2013. In recent history, I established and have been managing a
            semiprofessional volleyball team for the Volleyball League of
            America, even going as far as preparing a website for the team,
            which will be found in the links below when I complete it.

            I am recently engaged to a lovely woman named Jorden, and we both
            parent the adorable fur baby as well. She has a background in
            graphic design, so maybe we can become a duo that develops beautiful
            websites from our own office. We've already brainstormed multiple
            ideas that may come to fruition later in this year!

            My education has taken me all over the place. I first entered
            Arizona State University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Systems
            Engineering. My sophomore year, I decided to pursue psychology
            instead. I graduated in 2017, and for a short time floated around
            until I came back to engineering as a Fire Protection Design
            Engineer, even earning certification through NICET as a Level 2 with
            Water-Based Systems Layout. Now I'm looking to return to my previous
            passion in the tech world. Currently, I am pursuing education
            through the web development bootcamp hosted by the University of
            Arizona, and expecting to complete this in December of 2022.
